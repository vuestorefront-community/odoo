# Demonstration

This documentation is about Odoo integration with Alokai. This integration has been developed and maintained by ERPGAP / PromptEQUATION ❤️

Before anything, you should take a look in our live demo: https://alokai.labs.erpgap.com/ _it's a dev server so could be down sometimes_ :man_shrugging:

::: warning
We need to make clear that this hole documentation is about **Alokai + Odoo - Front End**, not about Odoo Back End. So, take a look in following explanations to better understand how it works.

## Alokai Community Projects explanation

We are Alokai integrators partners, so we make part of Alokai open source community. We keep our available projects in Github Alokai Community (https://github.com/vuestorefront-community) to keep everyting working:

- **[Odoo Alokai Modules](https://github.com/erpgap/alokai-odoo.git)**: This is where we maintain the Odoo modules that you need to install on your Odoo server. This will expose some GraphQL endpoints that will be used for Alokai server to serve and cache your Odoo information.

- **[Storefront Boilerplate](https://github.com/erpgap/storefront-ui.git)**: This is the project to start a new Alokai-odoo project. It's our main theme. So, if you want to start your own project, you'll need this repository to get started with your Nuxt3 project.

- **[Docker Compose Project](https://github.com/erpgap/alokai-docker.git)**: This is the fastest way to test Alokai and Odoo togeather. It contains the following containers: Postgresql Database, Odoo Server, Alokai Server and Redis Server.

When we start a new project from **Storefront Boilerplate**, the npm package with odoo composables and apis will be injected.
